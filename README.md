# Rapid Roll (A 2D Game)

Rapid Roll is a simple 2D platformer game which is built using iGraphics library(a modified version of `graphics.h` library). The goal is to control a ball (player) and survive as long as possible dropping down from platform to platform, deviating from red spikes. The difficulty level will increase gradually with time. If a player falls from the platform, a life is lost. Once the player lose all the lives, the game will be over.

## Development and Resources

This game is developed in C programming language. No game engines or any types of game development frameworks have been used in this. I've used the following tools:

* `iGraphics.h` library which is a modified version of `graphics.h`
* Visual Studio
* Microsoft Paint

### Objectives

* The objective of the game is to avoid destruction of the ball by earning points.
* By earning points and extra lives, the player could avoid “Game Over” as long as possible.

### Difficulty

* In game, the difficulty level will change gradually.
* The speed of the blocks will increase as time increases.
* The movement of the ball will also increase as well.

### Controls

* Move the ball using the `left` and `right` arrow keys of the keyboard.
* Avoid falling on red spikes and the floor.
* Survive as long as possible without hitting the ceiling.
